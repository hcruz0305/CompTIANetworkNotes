-Large networks need a "Logical addressing" method which is pretty much an IP address.
-Logical Addressing requires a network protocol

-No 2 systems on the same network share the same IP address, therefore a router (magic box) connects each of the subnets

-Routers use IP addresses instead of MAC addresses to forward data.


IP addresses are in the systems software and MACs are in the NIC's


Data is sent in the Frame
	- The Frame contains the Packet Header and the Data (Basically the IP stuff is in-between the Frame Header and FCS.
	- Packer contains the Destination IP and Source IP and Data

Example: It's an envelope with a "To" and "From" and inside the envelope Is Data. This then gets placed in a canister like in the bank were it gets sent to the bank teller. This canister is the Frame.
