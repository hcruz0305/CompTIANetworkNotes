	- Cabling, Hubs
	- NIC (Network Interface Card)
		○ 48 Bit Value and contains MAC addressees
		○ First 6 digits represent manufacturer (OUI), 
		○ Las 6 Digits are the Device ID
	- Ipconfig /all in terminal to view the MAC address and they are labeled as "Physical Address"
	- NIC receive data through Binary 1's and 0's
	- NIC creates and sends, as well as receives and reads the frames (Layer 2 PDU is "Frame")
	- All NICs on the same network must use the same frame type, or they will not be able to communicate with other NIC's
	- When a system sends a Frame it goes through the HUB which is dumb and then sends a copy of the frame to all connected ports and only the device with the matching MAC address would process that frame. This was eventually replaced by a Switch which
