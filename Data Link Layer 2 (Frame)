Layer 2 = Mac Address aka Physical adreses

FCS:

	- FCS are only 4 bytes long but the wired frame carries out at most 1500 bytes of data. Even though it is only 4 bytes, the FCS has a calculation called CRC that compared the Frame sent by the NIC and the Frame Received by the NIC to make sure they good
	- Bad CRC means frame is dropped

Broadcasting:
	- NIC's now the MAC Addresses it is sending to because it had previous communication and each system stores that data, however if it hasnâ€™t had communication, it will send a Broadcast onto the network asking for it.
	- If a NIC sends a Frame with a Broadcast address then every single NIC on the network will process that Frame
	- Without knowing MAC then it will us IP address to pick target (Layer 3 IP - Playing)

Frame Movement Process:

	1. NIC receives the command to send data and starts to make the frame
	2. Adding the data and FCS to the frame
	3. NIC sends the frame when no one else is using the wire, and puts both the Destination MAC address and its own MAC ito the frame
	4. The Frame has the MAC address for this NIC (Unicast Addressing)
	5. Layer 1 and Layer 2 are now properly applied to the network
	


*Switches handle traffic using MAC addresses so they operate in Layer 2

	


NICs break frames down into ones and zeros for transmission and the receiving NIC's rebuilds the frame on reciept.
